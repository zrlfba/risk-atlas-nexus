  name: 'The AI Risk Repository: A Comprehensive Meta-Review, Database, and Taxonomy
    of Risks From Artificial Intelligence'
  description: 'The risks posed by Artificial Intelligence (AI) are of considerable
    concern to academics, auditors, policymakers, AI companies, and the public. However,
    a lack of shared understanding of AI risks can impede our ability to comprehensively
    discuss, research, and react to them. This paper addresses this gap by creating
    an AI Risk Repository to serve as a common frame of reference. This comprises
    a living database of 777 risks extracted from 43 taxonomies, which can be filtered
    based on two overarching taxonomies and easily accessed, modified, and updated
    via our website and online spreadsheets. We construct our Repository with a systematic
    review of taxonomies and other structured classifications of AI risk followed
    by an expert consultation. We develop our taxonomies of AI risk using a best-fit
    framework synthesis. Our high-level Causal Taxonomy of AI Risks classifies each
    risk by its causal factors (1) Entity: Human, AI; (2) Intentionality: Intentional,
    Unintentional; and (3) Timing: Pre-deployment; Post-deployment. Our mid-level
    Domain Taxonomy of AI Risks classifies risks into seven AI risk domains: (1) Discrimination
    & toxicity, (2) Privacy & security, (3) Misinformation, (4) Malicious actors &
    misuse, (5) Human-computer interaction, (6) Socioeconomic & environmental, and
    (7) AI system safety, failures, & limitations. These are further divided into
    23 subdomains. The AI Risk Repository is, to our knowledge, the first attempt
    to rigorously curate, analyze, and extract AI risk frameworks into a publicly
    accessible, comprehensive, extensible, and categorized risk database. This creates
    a foundation for a more coordinated, coherent, and complete approach to defining,
    auditing, and managing the risks posed by AI systems.'
