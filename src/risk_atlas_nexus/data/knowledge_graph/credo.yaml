    AI Governance, Risk Management and Regulatory Compliance'
  description: The rapid advancement and deployment of AI systems have created an
    urgent need for standard safety-evaluation frameworks. This paper introduces AILuminate
    v1.0, the first comprehensive industry-standard benchmark for assessing AI-product
    risk and reliability. Its development employed an open process that included participants
    from multiple fields. The benchmark evaluates an AI system's resistance to prompts
    designed to elicit dangerous, illegal, or undesirable behavior in 12 hazard categories,
    including violent crimes, nonviolent crimes, sex-related crimes, child sexual
    exploitation, indiscriminate weapons, suicide and self-harm, intellectual property,
    privacy, defamation, hate, sexual content, and specialized advice (election, financial,
    health, legal). Our method incorporates a complete assessment standard, extensive
    prompt datasets, a novel evaluation framework, a grading and reporting system,
    and the technical as well as organizational infrastructure for long-term support
    and evolution. In particular, the benchmark employs an understandable five-tier
    grading scale (Poor to Excellent) and incorporates an innovative entropy-based
    system-response evaluation. In addition to unveiling the benchmark, this report
    also identifies limitations of our method and of building safety benchmarks generally,
    including evaluator uncertainty and the constraints of single-turn interactions.
    This work represents a crucial step toward establishing global standards for AI
    risk and reliability evaluation while acknowledging the need for continued development
    in areas such as multiturn interactions, multimodal understanding, coverage of
    additional languages, and emerging hazard categories. Our findings provide valuable
    insights for model developers, system integrators, and policymakers working to
    promote safer AI deployment.
